# Integrating Shell Scripting AWS to perform Basic Automation Tasks

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### TASK DESCRIPTION

In this project, I have created a shell script that will perform the following operations

> And allow user to format the volume and make partitions in it via the script and then mount it to a desired directory

> Also detach the volumes from that instance and deletes it

- WEBSERVERS

> Installs the Nginx Webserver and make changes in the configuration file to deploy a static website (HTML+CSS +JavaScript)

> Installs the APACHE Webserver and make changes in the configuration file to deploy a static website (HTML+CSS +JavaScript)

> Allows user to transfer the website code either from the local vm or directly from the Github repositories into the remote server

> Provide Some additional configuration for the nginx server like enabling gzip compression, limits the download speed for any specific resource from the website and also using HTTP2 version

- LOAD BALANCER

> Allows user to create an elastic loadbalancer, attaches the running instances.

> And also creates an additional S3 bucket for the loadbalancer access logs
